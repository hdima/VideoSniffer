Mozilla Firefox addon which collects URLs of viewed videos
==========================================================

*WARNING*: Unsupported

While you're viewing a flash video Video Sniffer trying to sniff the link to
the video and collect it to the "Collected Videos" context menu so you can
download it later. New links will be added at the top of the list. Only limited
number of links are collected (currently 20) and old links are removed to free
the space. To clear all collected links manually just click on "Clear List"
menu item.
